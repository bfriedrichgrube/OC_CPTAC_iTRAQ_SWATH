# OC_CPTAC_iTRAQ_SWATH
This repository provides R scripts on the analysis of the following publication: 


The analysis contains following steps: 
1) Processing of CPTAC iTRAQ DDA data downloaded from CPTAC data portal to a complete and filtered protein matrix.
2) Processing the output from the described OpenSWATH, pyProphet, TRIC pipeline with SWATH2stats and mapDIA for protein inference
3) Processing the mapDIA output of SWATH data to a final filtered and imputed protein matrix
4) Analyze SWATH data and iTRAQ data for technical details like peptide and protein variability, completeness and correlation
5) Comparison of molecular subtype classification
6) Bootstrapping algorithm for classification stability
7) Analysis of the mesenchymal subtype
8) Differential expression analysis of previously identified molecular subgroups
9) Analysis of HRD vs. non-HRD subgroups
